Project name: Pingui
Goal: Simple command based todo-list, for saving, removing and updating appointments 

HOW TO PINGUI:

	1) As first the project code has to be compiled with the command “g++ *.cpp” (without quotes) in the terminal, pointing to the folder where the project is stored;
	2) In order to start the program, the command “./a.out” (without quotes) has to be run after compiling the code;
	3) Now the Pingui console will greet you and wait for a new command. The set of possible commands can be viewed typing “help” (without quotes) in the Pingui console and pressing the enter button. Then it will be necessary to only choose what to do, type it within the console and press enter. Afterwards instructions on what to type will follow.
	4) In order to exit the application, when Pingui is waiting for a command, type “exit” (without quotes) and press enter.
